### Lecture 4

If you want to straight away put a link use `<link>` brackets like this <http://www.google.com>.

Or you could do like this `[google](link)` which will look like [google](http://www.google.com).

If you want to create a reference map -- which is a better choice if your links are going to change -- use like this -> `[Name][Link]`
 and then later in the last put `[Link]: Link`
 
[Name][1]
